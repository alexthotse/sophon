## Support for loading images into context with gpt-4o 🖼️

- You can now load images into context with `sophon load path/to/image.png`. Supported image formats are png, jpeg, non-animated gif, and webp. So far, this feature is only available with the default OpenAI GPT-4o model.

## No more hard OpenAI requirement for builder, verifier, and auto-fix roles 🧠

- Non-OpenAI models can now be used for *all* roles, including the builder, verifier, and auto-fix roles, since streaming function calls are no longer required for these roles.

- Note that reliable function calling is still required for these roles. In testing, it was difficult to find models that worked reliably enough for these roles, despite claimed support for function calling. For this reason, using non-OpenAI models for these roles should be considered experimental. Still, this provides a path forward for using open source, local, and other non-OpenAI models for these roles in the future as they improve.

## Reject pending changes with `sophon reject` 🚫

- You can now reject pending changes to one or more files with the `sophon reject` command. Running it with no arguments will reject all pending changes after confirmation. You can also reject changes to specific files by passing one or more file paths as arguments.

## Summarization and auto-continue fixes 🛤 ️

- Fixes for summarization and auto-continue issues that could Sophon to lose track of where it is in the plan and repeat tasks or do tasks out of order, especially when using `tell` and `continue` after the initial `tell`.

## Verification and auto-fix improvements 🛠️

- Improvements to the verification and auto-fix step. Sophon is now more likely to catch and fix placeholder references like "// ... existing code ..." as well as incorrect removal or overwriting of code.

## Stale context fixes 🔄

- After a context file is updated, Sophon is less likely to use an old version of the code from earlier in the conversation--it now uses the latest version much more reliably.

## `sophon convo` command improvements 🗣️

- Added a `--plain / -p` flag to `sophon convo` and `sophon summary` that outputs the conversation/summary in plain text with no ANSI codes.
- `sophon convo` now accepts a message number or range of messages to display (e.g. `sophon convo 1`, `sophon convo 1-5`, `sophon convo 2-`). Use `sophon convo 1` to show the initial prompt.

## Context management improvements 📄

- Give notes added to context with `sophon load -n 'some note'` an auto-generated name in the `context ls` list.
- `sophon rm` can now accept a range of indices to remove (e.g. `sophon rm 1-5`)
- Better help text if `sophon load` is run with incorrect arguments
- Fix for `sophon load` issue loading paths that begin with `./`

## Better rate limit tolerance 🕰️

- Increase wait times when receiving rate limit errors from OpenAI API (common with new OpenAI accounts that haven't spent $50)

## Built-in model updates 🧠

- Removed 'gpt-4-turbo-preview' from list of built-in models and model packs

## Other fixes 🐞

- Fixes for some occasional rendering issues when streaming plans and build counts
- Fix for `sophon set-model` model selection showing built-in model options that aren't compatible with the selected role--now only compatible models are shown

## Help updates 📚

- `sophon help` now shows a brief overview on getting started with Sophon rather than the full command list
- `sophon help --all` or `sophon help -a` shows the full command list
