##   ☄️  🌅   gpt-4o is the real deal for coding

- gpt-4o, OpenAI's latest model, is the new default model for Sophon. 4o is much better than gpt-4-turbo (the previous default model) in early testing for coding tasks and agent workflows.
- If you have not used `sophon set-model` or `sophon set-model default` previously to set a custom model, you will now be use gpt-4o by default. If you *have* used one of those commands, use `sophon set-model` or `sophon set-model default` and select the new `gpt-4o-latest` model-pack to upgrade.
 
##   🛰️  🏥   Reliability improvements: 90% reduction in syntax errors in early testing

- Automatic syntax and logic validation with an auto-correction step for file updates.
- Significantly improves reliability and reduces syntax errors, mistaken duplication or removal of code, placeholders that reference other code and other similar issues. 
- With a set of ~30 internal evals spanning 5 common languages, syntax errors were reduced by over 90% on average with gpt-4o. 
- Logical errors are also reduced (I'm still working on evals for those to get more precise numbers).
- Sophon is now much better at handling large files and plans that make many updates to the same file. Both could be problematic in previous versions.
- Sophon is much more resilient to incorrectly labelled file blocks when the model uses the file label format incorrectly to explain something rather than for a file. i.e. "Run this script" and then a bash script block. Previously Sophon would mistakenly create a file called "Run this script". It now ignores blocks like these.

##   🧠  🚞   Improvements to core planning engine: better memory and less laziness allow you to accomplish larger and more complex tasks without errors or stopping early

- Sophon is now much better at working through long plans without skipping tasks, repeating tasks it's already done, or otherwise losing track of what it's doing.
- Sophon is much less likely to leave TODO placeholders in comments instead of fully completing a task, or to otherwise leave a task incomplete.
- Sophon is much less likely to end a plan before all tasks are completed.

##   🏎️  📈   Performance improvements: 2x faster planning and execution

- gpt-4o is twice as fast as gpt-4-turbo for planning, summarization, builds, and more.
- If you find it's streaming too fast and you aren't able to review the output, try using the `--stop / -s` flag with `sophon tell` or `sophon continue`. It will stop the plan after a single response so you can review it before proceeding. Use `sophon continue` to proceed with the plan once you're ready.
- Speaking of which, if you're in exploratory mode and want to use less tokens, you can also use the `--no-build / -n` flag with `sophon tell` and `sophon continue`. This prevents Sophon from building files until you run `sophon build` manually.

##   💰  🪙   2x cost reduction: gpt-4o is half the per-token price of gpt-4-turbo

- For the same quantity of tokens, with improved quality and 2x speed, you'll pay half-price.

##   👩‍💻  🎭   New `sophon-dev` and `sdxd` alias in development mode

- In order to avoid conflicts/overwrites with the `sophon` CLI and `sdx` alias, a new `sophon-dev` command and `sdxd` alias have been added in development mode.

##  🐛  🛠️   Bug fixes

- Fix for a potential panic during account creation (https://github.com/sophon-ai/sophon/issues/76)
- Fixes for some account creation flow issues (https://github.com/sophon-ai/sophon/issues/106)
- Fix for occasional "Stream buffer tokens too high" error (https://github.com/sophon-ai/sophon/issues/34).
- Fix for potential panic when updating model settings. Might possibly be the cause of or somehow related to https://github.com/sophon-ai/sophon/issues/121 but hard to be sure (maybe AWS was just being flakey).
- Attempted fix for rare git repo race condition @jesseswell_1 caught that gives error ending with: 
```
Exit status 128, output
      * Fatal: unable to write new_index file
```

##   📚  🤔   Readme updates

- The [readme](https://github.com/sophon-ai/sophon) has been revamped to be more informative and easier to navigate.

##  🏡  📦   Easy self-contained startup script for local mode and self-hosting

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sophon-ai/sophon.git
cd sophon/app
./start_local.sh
``` 

- Sincere thanks to @ZanzyTHEbar aka @daofficialwizard on Discord who wrote the script! 🙏🙏

##   🚀  ☝️   Upgrading   

- As always, cloud has already been updated with the latest version. To upgrade the CLI, run any `sophon` command (like `sophon version` or `sophon help` or whatever command you were about to run anyway 🙂)
